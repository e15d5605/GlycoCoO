The patient was given 3 courses of methotrexate post-operatively and achieved a complete, sustained remission. The patient was readmitted because of progressive dyspnea and cough on June 8, 1980. On June 20, 1980, a thoracotomy was performed to establish a definitive diagnosis of multiple discrete lesions in the right lung field and biopsy revealed metastatic choriocarcinoma. The patient was treated post-operatively with methotrexate, actinomycin D and vinblastine but died on August 16, 1980, at that time the hCG titer continued to rise from 4,800 to 18,000 mIU/ml.

Normal pregnancy was excluded by ultrasonography, and uterine curettage was carried out which was highly suggestive of choriocarcinoma on pathological examination. The patient underwent simple hysterectomy and post-operative pathological examination showed intrauterine choriocarcinoma. After operation, the patient was treated with 5 courses of Etoposide (NK 171) and 2 courses of actinomycin D; 90 days later hCG could no longer be detected in serum samples by specific hCG \u03B2 radioimmunoassay.

The patient was given 3 courses of methotrexate post-operatively and achieved a complete, sustained remission. The patient was readmitted because of progressive dyspnea and cough on June 8, 1980. On June 20, 1980, a thoracotomy was performed to establish a definitive diagnosis of multiple discrete lesions in the right lung field and biopsy revealed metastatic choriocarcinoma. The patient was treated post-operatively with methotrexate, actinomycin D and vinblastine but died on August 16, 1980, at that time the hCG titer continued to rise from 4,800 to 18,000 mIU/ml. At autopsy, the patient had metastatic lesions of choriocarcinoma in the lung, liver, kidney, adrenal, intestine and skin. " .

The patient was admitted to the hospital in August, 1983, with abnormal vaginal bleeding three months after a full-term normal delivery. A pregnancy test was positive on admission and the concentration of urinary hCG was about 75,000 mIU/ml. Normal pregnancy was excluded by ultrasonography, and uterine curettage was carried out which was highly suggestive of choriocarcinoma on pathological examination. The patient underwent simple hysterectomy and post-operative pathological examination showed intrauterine choriocarcinoma. After operation, the patient was treated with 5 courses of Etoposide (NK 171) and 2 courses of actinomycin D; 90 days later hCG could no longer be detected in serum samples by specific hCG \u03B2 radioimmunoassay.

After N-acetylation, half of the sample was reduced with NaB<sup>2</sup>H<sub>4</sub> for methylation analysis. One-tenth of the tritium-labeled oligosaccharide fraction was added to the sample for the easy detection in further purification steps. Both the tritium- and deuterium-labeled oligosaccharide fractions were subjected to paper electrophoresis. The sample was incubated with sialidase and hydrolyzed with HCl at 100 degree Celsius for 3 min. The sample was first applied to a column of E-PHA-agarose. Both fractions were desalted on columns of Dowex SOW (H+) and Bio-Rad AG-3 (OH-), and then dried. Then, both fractions (passed through and elution of the remaining) were applied to a second lectin-agarose column of AAL-Sepharose. The samples bounded to the column were eluted with phosphate-buffered saline containing fucose. All fractions were desalted. The fractions contained fucose were subjected to Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography for removing it. Then, the all fractions were applied on to ConA-Sepharose column chromatography and eluted with buffer containing a-methyl mannoside. These fractions were desalted and the a-methyl mannoside that remained in fractions was removed by Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography. In order to determine the anomeric configuration and the sequence of each monosaccharide in the oligosaccharides, the radioactive peaks were subjected to sequential exoglycosidase digestion with jack bean \u03B2-galactosidase and jack bean \u03B2-<i>N</i>-acetylhexosaminidase, and then the reaction mixtures were analyzed by Bio-Gel P-4 column chromatography. The sample was then subjected to further sequential exoglycosidase digestions using jack bean \u03B1-mannosidase, snail \u03B2-mannosidase, jack bean \u03B2-<i>N</i>-acetylhexosaminidase and \u03B1-<sub>L</sub>-fucosidase. The sample was also digested with a mixture of diplococcal \u03B2-galactosidase and diplococcal \u03B2-<i>N</i>-acetylhexosaminidase. The sample was also digested with epididymal \u03B1-fucosidase (data not shown). Depends on the presence or absence of a bisecting GlcNAc, a fucose, and two \u03B1-mannosyl residues unsubstituted at positions C-3, 4, and 6, the procedures of separating sugar chains are combined with respective lectin-agarose columns. Because of the amount limitation, the sample obtained on sialidase treatment of the deuterium-labeled oligosaccharide fraction was subjected to methylation analysis without further purification by sequential chromatography.

On the day before the extraction, the sample was batched and immersed in liquid nitrogen for 5 min before being returned to a -20 C deep freeze. Six hundred frozen glands were homogenized in Tris-phosphate buffer and stirred for 2 h and centrifuged for 1 h. The pellet was rehomogenized with the same Tris-phosphate buffer, stirred for 1 h, and centrifuged for 1 h. The pellet was then homogenized three times with Tris-phosphate buffer and centrifuged as before. The supernatants were combined, filtered through a funnel packed with glass wool, mixed, and added acetic acid to pH 6.3. The sample was then centrifuged for 16 h. The supernatant was decanted, and the pellet was washed with extraction buffer adjusted to pH 6.3 concentrated HCl. The washings were added to the supernatant fraction. The sample was added acetic acid to reduce pH 4.9 and chilled absolute ethanol with stirring. The sample was left for 8 h and centrifuged for 1 h. The sample was decanted. The sample was frozen and provided. A crude precipitate from gland was ultracentrifuged, filtered on Sephadex G-100 and subjected to chromatography on DEAE-Sephacel. The sample was further purified by Sephadex G-100 column chromatography (Nishimura et al., unpublished data). The sample was subjected to the polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and stained with Coomassie blue or periodic acid-Schiff reagent; the mobility of which was the same as that of the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG)-\u03B1 subunit and it showed that there is no human luteinizing hormone (hLH) or human thyroid-stimulating hormone (hTSH) activity, as judged on radioimmunoassaying." .

The DNA eluted from the column by using the same buffer was precipitated with alcohol and redissolved in Tris-HCl/EDTA. The sample was heated to inactivate neuraminidase and purified on a C-4 Vydac reverse-phase HPLC column using an acetonitrile gradient in trifluoroacetic acid (TFA). The fractions containing erythropoietin were digested to completion with TPCK-treated trypsin. The sample was then subjected to reverse-phase HPLC. The samples were analyzed  N-terminal sequence directly and synthesized oligonucleotide probes. The oligonucleotides were labelled at the 5' end using polynucleotide kinase and [gamma-32P]ATP.  A human genomic DNA library in bacteriophage lambda43 was screened using a modification of the in situ amplification procedure and tetramethylammonium chloride as the hybridization salt. DNA was digested to completion with Sau3A and subcloned into M13 for DNA sequence-analysis using the dideoxy chain termination method. The vector was transfected to Chinese hamster ovary cells. The sample was purified from the spent medium of Chinese hamster ovary cells. The sample was dissolved in PBS at 4 degree Celsius and LiCl were added. The sample was added absolute ethanol at 4 degree Celsius slowly and stirring for 30 min. After for 15 min, the sample was centrifuged, then the pellet was washed three times with ethanol, LiCl and the supernatants were pooled. The precipitate was dissolved in PBS. The combined supernatants were added absolute ethanol slowly and stirring for 30 min and settling for 15 min. The precipitate was collected as before and washed twice with ethanol, LiCl, and the supernatants were pooled. The washed precipitate was dissolved in PBS. The pooled supernatants were added ethanol slowly and stirring for 30 min, after that the precipitate was allowed to settle for 14 h at 4 degree Celsius. The precipitate was washed twice with ethanol, LiCl, the supernatants were pooled, and the precipitate was dissolved in PBS. The combined supernatant was added absolute alcohol and stirred for 30 min.
